Malaria still possesses challenges to the health status and socioeconomic welfare of the
population in Tanzania. 

Its effect includes high morbidity and mortality rates. This project
aims to develop a model for predicting malaria prevalence in a certain region. Secondary
data from the School Malaria and Nutrition Survey for the survey years 2015, 2017, 2019,
and 2021 covering over 650 schools and 60000+ records of pupils in Tanzaniaâ€™s mainland
was analyzed and performed feature extractions to extract features that can be used were
predict malaria prevalence. 

Features were used in the training our naive Bayes machine
learning model. The model had a Mean absolute error and Mean squared error 13.47 and
406.41 respectively. The model was then used to predict malaria prevalence of regions in
Tanzania.
